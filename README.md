🏢 Business Context

SecureTech Solutions, a security technology provider operating across Nigeria, South Africa, Kenya, and Morocco, was expanding its regional footprint but lacked visibility into its growing sales pipeline. The sales team struggled to prioritize urgent opportunities, track rep performance, and align resources across countries.

This project provided an Excel-based Sales Analytics Dashboard that transformed raw sales data into actionable insights, enabling better pipeline management, lead prioritization, and strategic decision-making.

📌 Project Overview

This dashboard enables sales managers to:

Assess total deal value by country, product type, and urgency level

Evaluate sales rep and regional performance

Prioritize high-value, urgent opportunities

Improve pipeline forecasting and reporting

🛠️ Workflow
1. Data Preparation

Cleaned raw sales data (deal size, urgency, sales stage, rep assignment)

Created derived columns for segmentation (urgency tiers, product categories)

2. Analysis

Built PivotTables for:

Deal value by country/product/urgency

Rep and regional sales performance

Pipeline stage breakdowns

3. Dashboard Development

KPIs: Total Deal Value, High-Urgency Deals, Top Performing Reps

Visuals: Bar charts, stacked columns, donut charts, summary tables

Interactivity: Slicers (Country, Urgency, Sales Rep, Stage)

Conditional formatting for quick insights

🔍 Insights & Recommendations

Morocco → High deal value but few reps → allocate additional sales staff

Kenya → Rising demand for safe deposit boxes → launch targeted campaign and boost inventory

Rep John → High-value deals but low closure → provide coaching/support

Urgency → Many urgent deals stuck in early stages → implement fast-track process and tighter follow-up

✅ Outcomes

Clear visibility into pipeline health across regions

Better lead prioritization based on urgency and value

Informed strategic rep assignments

Improved sales forecasting and reporting

📁 Tools Used

Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, Charts, Slicers, Conditional Formatting)

Manual + formula-based data cleaning

🚀 Learnings

Reinforced importance of data cleaning for accurate analysis

Improved dashboard design skills with focus on clarity, interactivity, and storytelling

Demonstrated how Excel can function as a lightweight BI tool for non-technical stakeholders
